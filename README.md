#contact

This is my first write up on creating a simple web application from plain from post to SPA using different front-end/tooling and backend technologies or frameworks/libraries.

I will start with a classic one, which you do form post for every actions. 


Everything starts with an idea. 

For this write up, I have decided to create a simple contact list management. We will treat this as we are making a product from ground up.


The Product

    - Able to save user information such as Name, Address, Phone Number
    - Able to edit contact information
    - Able to delete contact information
    - Able to search contact information


Tech Stacks
We have defined the product we wanted to create, now we should think about the technologies we are going to use.

    -------
    Node
    Express

    DB
